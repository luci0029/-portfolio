# -portfolio
I created this portfolio with a clear vision ahead. It took hours and hours to complete but I achieved the look I was aiming to get. 
I had trouble creating the slideshow transitions smoothly as it was my third time using javascript. However, with a lot of research and libraries I managed to get the 
transitions as smooothly as I wanted. 
Then I had some trouble creating the grid for my gallery portfolio. As I went back to old notes and did some more research I got the code to work just as I waned it.
